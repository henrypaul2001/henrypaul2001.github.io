      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <h3>Toadm'n</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Toadm'n</strong> is a 2D puzzle-platformer game prototype built using Unity as a team for a university project. In the game, you must navigate a toad through various levels. The toad can be controlled by clicking and dragging to make him leap. The WASD keys are used to control a group of flies around the screen, pressing the spacebar makes the toad launch his tongue at the flies. The flies can thus be used to make the toad interact with the environment by pulling levers and pressing buttons. The player is then given a score based on how long it took to complete the level, the number of times they licked the flies and the amount of respawns they used.

      <h3>Commercial Games Development Process</h3>
      <p>
        This group project was a part of a course called "Commercial Games Development Process". The first half of the course consisted of a solo design task in which we had to write up our own game design document, discussing gameplay mechanics, story elements, marketing, target demographics, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game I came up with was called "Tanktopia", you can read about it <a href="Tanktopia.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        The second half of the course was the group task. We formed teams and each member of the team proposed the game they designed in the first half. We had to choose one of these games, or a combination of them, and develop a prototype of that game as a team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each member of the team would fill a specific role that would be found in a professional team. My role was <strong>lead programmer</strong>. The first step I felt I needed to take was to discuss the design with the person who came up with the game proposal in further detail to make sure the gameplay mechanics and systems were clearly defined. I created a list of programming tasks from the initial design and this discussion. I then estimated the time needed to implement each of these tasks and used Microsoft Project to draw up an initial development timeline. With each task and their pre-requisites taking shape, I created a project board in the GitHub repository (a kan-ban style project board) and placed each task on it with a priority level and details on the task requirements. I then spoke with the programmers to assign tasks throughout the project based on each persons experience with different Unity features, including myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the group was small, the design team needed help with some level design later in the project. So, I took ownership of one of the levels in the game that I found interesting from the design document in which the toad navigates a dark cave, the flies are replaced with fireflies, and you must use the glow from the fireflies to light the way through the cave.
