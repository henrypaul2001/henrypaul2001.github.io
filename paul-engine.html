      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Paul Engine</strong> is my long term personal project. A custom C++ game engine built using OpenGL.
        It started as a simple C++ port of a C# engine I built during university, but quickly evolved into something 
        far more complex and ambitious.<br><br>It represents my growth as a programmer and my mindset for learning. From scrappy and experimental beginnings focussed on features, to deliberate architecture and clean code.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Timeline & Evolution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial inspiration (Late 2022 - Early 2023):</strong><br>A very basic <a href="https://github.com/henrypaul2001/ECSGameEngineDLL" target="_blank">C# engine</a> built in a university course focussing
             on ECS design and general game architecture. I remember being disappointed that we built this using C# instead of C++, as it would have been a valuable confidence builder with the C++ language.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting the project (October 2023):</strong><br>After graduating, I knew I needed more experience with C++ if I wanted to enter the games industry. 
            So I started a basic port of the C# engine. Since we mainly used C# at university in general, this was the perfect opportunity to push myself into C++.
            However, I had a lot to learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Increasing scope (Late 2023 - 2024):</strong><br>The project now far surpassing the original inspiration. Each feature implemented was done so at a higher quality than the last, 
            showing my C++ skills evolve over time. But it was all being held together by a rotten core. 
            Those early beginnings. I didn't want to have to add the footnote <i>"don't look too closely at the early stuff"</i> when asked about my work anymore. 
            <br>Features are great, I was enjoying learning about a variety of different topics. But,
        for me to feel comfortable showcasing this engine, work needed to be done fixing the core.</li>
        <li><strong>A short break (Late 2024):</strong><br>After implementing screen space reflections in the engine, I suddenly became fascinated by ray tracing and wondered if it was something I could do.
        So, I took a break from the game engine and began exploring path tracing with another project: <a href="https://github.com/henrypaul2001/GLTrace" target="_blank">GLTrace</a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>ECS Re-write (Early 2025):</strong><br>After the break, I knew it was time to start re-writing this game engine. And so, I started with the entity component system.
        This is a core element of a modern game engine. My original implementation worked, but it was clunky to use and wasn't very flexible. But the main issue with the original was memory inefficiency.
        I re-designed the system to be significantly more cache consistent, more flexible and easier to use.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Teardown (Early 2025 - Ongoing):</strong><br>I was happy with the ECS re-design. But the core of the engine was still a mess. 
            Even down to the file structure. Something needed to change. So, I created a new branch in the github repo titled "Teardown" and deleted every single file.
        <br>I knew I had a monumental task ahead of me. Taking what I learned so far, I set out to rebuild the engine from the ground up.<br>My goal: feature parity, robust architecture.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Teardown Branch</h2>
      <p>Earlier this year, I created a new branch in the project repo called <i>teardown</i>. I deleted everything and started fresh, applying everything I had learned. The goal is to rebuild all the features from the original version but with a much stronger design,
         as well as some much needed features.
        <br>This rewrite introduces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A proper separation between the engine and the game runtime</li>
        <li>Editor application</li>
        <li>Graphics API agnostic design</li>
        <li>Improved file structure</li>
        <li>Improved memory management</li>
        <li>Clean application backend</li>
        <li>Overhauled features</li>
        <li>Improved asset handling</li>
        <li>Scene serialization</li>
        <li>and more... (promise)</li>
      </ul>
